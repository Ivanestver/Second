With bloodshot eyes, I watch you sleeping
The warmth I feel beside me is slowly fading
Would she hear me if, I called her name?
Would she hold me, if she knew my shame?

There's always something different going wrong!
The path I walk's in the wrong direction!
There's always someone fucking hanging on!
Can anybody help me make things better?

Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscience calls, the guilty to come home
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscience calls, the guilty to come home

Would she hear me, if I called her name?
Would she hold me, if she knew my shame?

There's always something different going wrong!
The path I walk's in the wrong direction!
There's always someone fucking hanging on!
Can anybody help me make things better?

Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscience calls, the guilty to come home (tears don't fall)
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me (conscience calls)
Her conscience calls, the guilty to come
Better!
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me (conscience calls)
Her conscience calls, the guilty to come home!
Her conscience calls, the guilty to come home!
